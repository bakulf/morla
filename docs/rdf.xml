    <title>The RDF format</title>

    <p>The Resource Description Framework (<b>RDF</b>) can be described as
    a list of statements. Any statement is composed by a <i>subject</i>, 
    a <i>predicate</i> and an <i>object</i>. With a RDF Document you can
    describe what you want with some semantic rules. You documents will be
    machines-understanble.</p>
