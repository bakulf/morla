    <title>About Morla...</title>

    <p>
      Morla is a multiplatform editor of RDF documents. It is based on libnxml
      and librdf libraries. With Morla you can manage more RDF documents
      simultaneously, visualize graphs and use templates for quick writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Morla you can import RDFS documents and use its content to write
      new RDF triples. Templates are also RDF documents and they make Morla
      easily personalizeble and expandable.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also use Morla as RDF navigator, wandering among the net knots
      of the RDF documents present on internet exactly as we are used to do
      with normal browsers.
